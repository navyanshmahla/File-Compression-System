# File-Compression-System
This is a simple repo that contains the implementation of the popular file compression algorithms

This repository contains the implementation of the following compression algorithms:
1. Run Length encoding
2. Huffman encoding
3. Information entropy
4. Lempel Ziv 

This repo is a supplement to the implementations of the algorithms that have been discussed in my blog here: https://navyanshmahla.github.io/posts/Information-Theory-and-Compression-Algorithms/
